        <h2>About Peyton</h2>
        <p>I am currently working at <a href="https://www.insomniacookies.com/" target="_blank">Insomnia Cookies</a> as a delivery driver and have to focus on working fast and customer service. This has taught me how to communicate as a team and be efficient in my work.</p>
        <p>As a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>, both my current knowledge and communication skills have been tested as I continue to learn more about coding.</p>
        <p>My interest in coding sparked from my love for puzzles and video games, I see coding as a puzzle since it is putting pieces together until you reach the desired outcome, except you make the pieces yourself. My love for video games has pushed me to go further in hopes of one day creating my own or work on a team with the same goal.</p>
